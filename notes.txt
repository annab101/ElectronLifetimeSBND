Things a config file would need in it:

codeConfig
tag
maxWireGroup
N_bins:
- should have option for bins in x, t, dQdx, max and min values
mydata_cosmics - i.e the folder where everything is done from

should be
cosmics_analysis/lifetime_analysis/

then want a folder where that particular run is saved
e.g make folder 2022Afull/
This folder should be an option/config thing so that it is consistent

Saving conventions:

Want
dQdx_hist_ + classic/multiwire/multihit/angle/wireAndAngle + dataset (e.g 2022Afull)
dQdx_proj_ + classic/multiwire/multihit/angle/wireAndAngle + dataset (e.g 2022Afull)
MPV_ + + classic/multiwire/multihit/angle/wireAndAngle + dataset (e.g 2022Afull)

Each root file contains hists/graphs that are named individually
dQdx_hist... contains hists labelled by basic/nWires10/nHits10/ang60to80/ang60to80nWires10

Config bit of name can be done in code - classic/multiwire/...
Dataset bit of name can be done in config file or as option
Config bit of root file name can be done in code too

Config options:
Either:
Header file with everything in 
Or:
config reader like Rhiannon has
Or:
Something similar - needs to be accessed by all the bits of code consistently

Files to run in order:
dQdx_hist.cpp
MPV.cpp
fitMPV.cpp
